    /*1. Role of mappedBy
    mappedBy is set on the inverse side of a two-way association (usually in @OneToMany)
    and specifies the name of the field in the other Entity, through which the relationship
    is already defined.

    Thanks to this, JPA does not create an additional FK column on the inverse side, but
    uses the column defined in the owner side.

    2. Owner side vs. inverse side
    Owner side is the Entity where @ManyToOne + @JoinColumn(name = "...") is present.
    There name specifies the name of the FK column in the table of the owner entity itself.

    The inverse side (where you use mappedBy) does not contain @JoinColumn;
    instead, mappedBy points to the name of the field in the owner entity, without dealing with DB columns.*/
